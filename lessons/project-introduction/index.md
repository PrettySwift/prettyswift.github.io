title: Project Introduction - SwiftCatalog
---

Throughout the rest of the Pretty Swift course, you will be working to build a simple catalog application with a master-detail user interface. Master-detail is a common user interface pattern on iOS. The master view controller shows a collection of objects. The detail view controller presents more information about a single selected object.

Completing the SwiftCatalog project for Pretty Swift will teach you the highlights of iOS development and reinforce the concepts you learned in the Pretty Swift course.

When you are finished, the application will have two screens: a master screen that shows a list of catalog items and a detail screen showing more information about a selected catalog item.
