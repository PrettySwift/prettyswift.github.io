# Lesson Objectives
- Learn how to create a custom `UIView` Subclass
- Understand the major communication patterns used in Apple's frameworks: delegation, notifications, blocks, and target-action.

# Readings
- Complete the [Implement a Custom Control](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/Lesson5.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40015214-CH19-SW1) section of *Start Developing iOS Apps (Swift)*.
- Read [Communication Patterns](https://www.objc.io/issues/7-foundation/communication-patterns).

# Quiz
1. What is the difference between the `frame` and `bounds` properties on `UIView`? If you get stuck, read this [resource](https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CocoaViewsGuide/Coordinates/Coordinates.html).
2. What is a delegate? When would you use the notification pattern instead of the delegate pattern?

# Project
- Checkout the [`views` branch](https://github.com/PrettySwift/SwiftCatalog/tree/views) of the SwiftCatalog project.
- Follow the instructions in the [README](https://github.com/PrettySwift/SwiftCatalog/blob/views/README.md) file to create a custom view to display a circular image. Code blocks that require modification are marked as `TODO`.
